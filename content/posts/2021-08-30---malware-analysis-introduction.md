Welcome to the new malware analysis blog series! In this series, I will post my notes, observations, and everything else that (I hope) will help me to learn a new skill - malware analysis. If you like to learn this together - welcome on board!

## Start with WHY
My motivation:
1. Do it for fun! Well ok. I was doing some malware analysis before but it has never be done in a structured way, it wasn't serious. However, by having this experience I can tell that analyzing malware is fun, you can have this feeling as a detective, who gathers these little dots and connect them later on.
2. Become a better malware developer by learning on real cases - from "the best" in the industry ;-). 
3. Improve red teaming skills by gathering new ideas for implementing niche techniques in the initial access part of the operation.
4. Learn Windows internals. As of course, there is malware for other OS, this blog series will be very Windows-oriented at least at first.

## Resources
Usually, I'm not sticking to one course to learn a new skill but for me, it's helpful to have some courses as reference for learning. I pick up these two:
* [Zero2Automated by 0verflow_ and Vitali Kremez](https://courses.zero2auto.com/adv-malware-analysis-course). I pick this one because it's very affordable and for me has the most interesting syllabus. 
* [INE - Malware Analysis Professional](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/e831d3ee-18b5-4b46-b1a7-9f7b3d65feae/malware-analysis-professional). I heard different opinions about INE, but already have access to INE yearly pass, so will give this course a try.

This series will not be focused on any of these resources as I don't like to spoil and double the knowledge which you can find there. Instead, I'd like to share with you notes from my journey.

## Other resources worth mention
There are a lot of resources about malware analysis. In my opinion, there is no point in bombarding with all available resources, so I tried to pick the most valuable and the most recommended: 
* [SANS FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware: Malware Analysis Tools and Techniques](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/) - I heard so many good opinions about this course. Unfortunately, now I can afford this 8000$ course fee ;-)
* [Malware Analysis series by John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9-X_NRlJc&list=PL1H1sBF1VAKWMn_3QPddayIypbbITTGZv)
* [Malware Analysis series by Colin Hardy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkSJn8sGAKw&list=PLC9K7uaDMdAXPnInKDK5D033TyDKf9Cgt)
* [Practical Malware Analysis book](https://nostarch.com/malware) - it's from 2012 can be oldy.
